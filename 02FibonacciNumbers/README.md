# fibonacci numbers

User Stories:

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers obtained by summation of two preceding elements. The sequence goes as:0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦

Develop an app that prints a sequence of Fibonacci numbers on the screen. Store the numbers as a state property and initialize them with first two elements: 0 and 1. Each second a new number is added to the sequence and printed on the screen.
After all the numbers are printed, display the current number of elements in the Fibonacci sequence and their sum.

Example:

At some point your app may look like:

0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
ELEMENTS: 8 SUM: 32
